# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to go through the dataset and provide meaningful visualizations using Tableau.

## Process
I chose option 2 FIFA 2018 Player Ratings. After I downloaded the dataset and opened it in Tableau, I immediately noticed that there are lots of columns with attritubes that I do not understand. Thus, I went back to the excel file and deleted some of the columns, especially the ones with abbreviations. To my understanding, this dataset has 17k players with 70 attributes. That is what I wanted to focus on, provide meaning visualizations about the attributes. I started by showing "wage" versus "nationality" and tried to narrwo everything down to top 5 players. 

## Results
Option 2 : FIFA 2018 Player Rating 

In order to narrow it down to top five players, I started my research with wage versus nationality. I believe top players in the world will have top wages and I can locate them with nationality.

This graph shows the top 10 countries in the world that have players with the highest wage earned.

This illustrates where the players with the most wage earned are distributed, red means the highest and yellow means the least.

Now that I have a base understanding of the top countries in the world. I asked myself who exactly earned that much in those countries. Here shows the result. The top players include Neymar from Brazil, Messi from Argentina, Ronaldo from Portugal..etc. This visualization shows the top 100 players with the most market value.

Now that I have the top 100 soccer players in the world, I can finally find out what are the attributes of each player. However, in order to categorize all the attributes, a little research has to be done. I found that FIFA put all the attributes into 6 different categories : dribbling, pacee, physical, passing, shooting and defending. For example, physical category includes jumping, stamina, strength and aggression attributes. I noticed there is a general pattern among all the soccer player. Most of the players' defending category falls between 30 to 60.

This is the top 5 players I chose and their attributes. They are Cristiano Ronaldo, E.Hazard, Lionel Messi, Neymar, and R.lewandowski. As you can, even the top players have relatively low defnding attributes score.

## Challenges 
I think the challenging aspect of this project is to find the appropriate visualization to represent the findings I want to tell everyone. Another challenging aspect is to ask meaningful questions from the dataset. 

## Future Goals
In the future if I had more time, I would do more research on the relationships between attributes and players. The reason being, this dataset has ennormous amount of records on attributes and I feel I am not digging deep enough into this aspect.
